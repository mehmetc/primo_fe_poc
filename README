This is a proof of concept we have been looking at(but it is dormant now). It is a jQuery based frontend with a Rails backend that translates and streamlines data from and to the Primo/Aleph server.
All communication between the client and backend is done is JSON. If you are interested in this and need help implementing it send me an email.

	- jQuery based
	- Javascript templates
	- Extended query language(use of indexes in simple search)
	- Persistent client side URLS
	- RTA
	- BX integration
	- SFX integration
	- ...

Installation:
	copy config/example_database.yml -> config/database.yml and update
	update config/initializers/libis.rb

	rake gems:install  
	rake db:create db:migrate
